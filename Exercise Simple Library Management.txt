Exercise: Simple Library Management System

1. Abstract Base Class

Create an abstract class called LibraryItem with:
id (int)
title (String)
isBorrowed (boolean)

Methods:
borrowItem()
returnItem()
getItemType() → abstract
getDescription() → abstract

2. Subclasses

Create two subclasses:
Book
author (String)
pages (int)

Magazine
issueNumber (int)

Each subclass must:
Implement getItemType()
Implement getDescription()

3. Library Class

Create a Library class that:
Stores a list of LibraryItem

Can:
Add items
List all items
Borrow an item by ID
Return an item by ID

4. Main Program

In Main:
Create a library
Add several books and magazines
Borrow and return items
Print results to the console

Step-by-Step Tasks (Student Path):
Design the LibraryItem abstract class
Implement encapsulation using getters/setters
Create Book and Magazine subclasses
Use method overriding
Create a Library class using ArrayList<LibraryItem>
Demonstrate polymorphism in action
Test everything in main()

EXTENSION TASKS:
1. Borrowing Rules
Prevent borrowing an item if it’s already borrowed
Print a clear message when borrowing fails
Prevent returning an item that isn’t borrowed

2. Unique ID Validation
Prevent adding two items with the same ID
Print an error if a duplicate ID is found

3. Override toString()
Override toString() in each subclass
Use it instead of getDescription()

4. Search Features
Add methods to:
Search by title (partial match)
List all available items only
List borrowed items only

5. User Class       -7
Create a User class:
id
name
List of borrowed items
Limit of borrowed items (e.g. max 3)

Update borrowing logic to:
Track who borrowed what
Enforce borrow limits

6. Move Logic into Objects     -8
Move borrow/return logic into LibraryItem
Let Library coordinate instead of control

7. Exceptions       -12
Throw exceptions for:
Item not found
Borrowing an already borrowed item

Catch and handle them in Main
